Phase 1 -> scaffolding

- [ ] Finish project structure on obsidian ➕ 2025-11-03
- [ ] Create GitHub scaffold
- [ ] read supporting literature 


# Phase 2 -> further research and basics 
- [ ] explore LTSM and GRU networks for practice via inbuilt pytorch functions  ➕ 2025-11-03
- [ ] Verify if backtesting is viable through monte-carlo and donchian breakout ➕ 2025-11-03


# Phase 3 -> data handling
- [ ] create tick framework [[Pre - Processing]] but for EOD not 15 min
- [ ] extract pivots and features to create a dataset 
- [ ] implement algorithm 1 in [[Feature Extraction]]


# Phase 4 -> data processing 
- [ ] apply normalisations and test which one works the best with the same metrics as the paper ➕ 2025-11-03
- [ ] split data according to paper (standard 80, 10, 10 train, test, validation)
- [ ] Implement data features ? 🔺 TBA 

# Phase 5 -> deep learning
- [ ] create the LTSM and GRU 
- [ ] sort inputs and outputs 
- [ ] hyperparameter turning with Keras 

# Phase 6 -> Eval and Backtesting 

TBA
