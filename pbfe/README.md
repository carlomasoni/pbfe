Pattern-Based Feature Extraction for EOD Financial Time Series
This project adapts the methodology from "Pattern-Based Feature Extraction for Improved Deep Learning in Financial Time Series Classification" (Hosseini et al., 2025, IEEE Access) to End-of-Day (EOD) data.

# DONE

- data from EOD csv is cleaned
- data is normalised and plotted -> returns only for visualisation
- all data is normalised for training 



- use normalised data to train LTSM and GRU to see which normalisation is the best 
- most likley same as paper but good practice for future projects / testing series / other ppl 
- OHLC or just close for training? e.g. multivariate vs univariate. How to test properly which use case is necessary. 
- clean up everything a bit. WATCH OUT FOR FILE PATHS -> especially in SRC 

- feature extraction
- data pipeline 

#TODO 

-Dataset expansion via main cfg 



REMOVED for readding 

- scripts directory
